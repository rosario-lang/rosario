# Rosario Programming Language

## Empowering Safety with Groups and Trees!

Rosario aims to be a strongly typed, blazingly fast and fully safe programming language, helping you to focus into what's important: build and finish fast, safe, and great software.

# Features.

*WARNING: The language its in its very early developement stage, some of the features will not work 100% yet.*

## Just Think in Groups and Trees, its *that* easy!

Rosario is heavily focused around groups (arrays, vectors, hashmaps, etc.) and tree structuring (variables that contain groups of other variables).

While this approach seems simple, it helps you with building entire projects, architechtures and systems, that are simple and easy to understand and work with no matter the scale.

## Incredibly Strong Type and Trait System.

*TODO*.

## No borrow checker, no garbage collector, no reference counting, FULL Safety.

Because of all of the features mentioned above, the language doesn't need a garbage collector to clear unused variables, or the borrow checker and the reference counter to keep track of lifetimes...

Thanks to the Groups and Trees, not only the compiler knows where the lifetime of a variable begins and ends, its x1000 easier for **YOU** and other programmers to know the lifetimes of all of the variables of your program.

This results in the language being incredibly simple and powerful, without any fancy feature that can either slow your program down, or slow YOU down.

## Designed to help you focus on what you have to do.

We believe that the language shouldn't stop you for hours because of an issue that isn't related to the logic of your program: From the garbage collector leaking memory, to the borrow checker showing up all of the sudden to enforce its rules, to doing a "use after free" a couple of times and not knowing where, etcetera.

Rosario aims to help you to solve any sort of problem related to its rules as quickly as possible, so you can get back on track and finish your goals.

## The saner the programmer, the better the result.

We believe that your time is always valuable, whether you code as a hobby, or as a full time job.

And something what we could probably agree on, is that nobody wants to deal with problems that the compiler wasn't able to catch properly, resulting in simple mistakes that could bring all of your entire architechture down... Specially when these show up at 2AM in the morning, with 4 hours left to the deadline and your entire blood stream being replaced with coffee.

Rosario will stop you from writing anti-patterns before they become a problem (in form of compiler errors), and even if you manage to write anti-patterns despite with all of the checks in place, the language's design will help you easily recognize these problems and fix them, turning hours of constant trial and error into something that you can solve in a matter of seconds.

Your time and mental health is important to get your goals done, so you can deliver something that is as excellent as possible.

## Compiles to C for FAST performance, portability, and comfort.
